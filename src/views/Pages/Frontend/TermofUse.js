                                    <p>Subject to these Terms you may modify a template, training course or incident workflow in the Service for the purposes of developing customizations and additional features of a template, training course or incident workflow. Any such modifications constitute “Your Modifications”. You may use Your Modifications solely with respect to your own instances in support of your permitted use of the service, but you may not distribute Your Modifications to any third party. Notwithstanding anything in these Terms to the contrary, Retail OEP has no support, warranty, indemnification or other obligation or liability with respect to Your Modifications or their combination, interaction or use with our Services.

This indemnification obligation is subject to your receiving (i) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for you to respond without prejudice); (ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, or settlement of such claim; and (iii) all reasonably necessary cooperation of Retail OEP at your expense.</p>
                                    <p>We will defend you against any claim brought against you by a third party alleging that the Services, when used as authorized under this Agreement, infringe a third parties’ intellectual property rights (a “Claim”), and we will indemnify you and hold you harmless against any damages and costs finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed to settlement by us, arising out of a Claim, provided that we have received from you: (a) prompt written notice of the Claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for us to respond without prejudice); (b) reasonable assistance in the defense and investigation of the Claim, including providing us a copy of the Claim and all relevant evidence in your possession, custody or control; and (c) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, and settlement (if applicable) of the Claim. If your use of a Service is (or in our opinion is likely to be) materially reduced, if required by settlement, or if we determine such actions are reasonably necessary to avoid material liability, we may, at our option and in our sole discretion: (i) procure a license for your continued use of the Services in accordance with this Agreement; (ii) substitute a substantially functionally similar Service; or (iii) terminate your right to continue using the Service and refund any prepaid amounts for the terminated portion of the Service.

                                <p>Services are provided on a subscription basis for a set Term as specified in your Order. Except as otherwise specified in your Order, all subscriptions will automatically renew for periods equal to your initial Term (and you will be charged at the then-current rates) unless you cancel your subscription in writing or through your account at the Site. If you cancel, your subscription will terminate at the end of then-current billing cycle, but you will not be entitled to any credits or refunds for amounts accrued or paid prior to such termination.</p>
                                <p>If Retail OEP does not want the Services to renew, then it will provide you written notice to this effect. This notice of non-renewal will be effective upon the conclusion of the then current Term.</p>

                                <p>You agree to pay all Fees in accordance with your Online Order or Quote/Order Form. Unless otherwise specified in your Online Order or Quote/Order Form, you will pay all amounts in the offered currency (as updated from time to time) at the time you place your Online Order or Quote/Order Form. All amounts are non-refundable, non-cancellable and non-creditable.</p>
                                <p>In making payments, you acknowledge that you are not relying on future availability of the Service beyond the current agreed Term or any Service upgrades or feature enhancements. If you add End Users during your Term, we will charge you for the increased number of End Users pursuant to the then-currently applicable rates in your next billing cycle. You agree that we may bill your credit card for renewals, additional End Users, and unpaid fees, as applicable.</p>
                                <p>You must elect one of the following billing options when registering and placing an order for the Service:</p>
                                <ol>
                                	<li><b>Monthly Plan:</b> If you select this option, you will pay for the Services on a monthly basis. We will bill you: (i) Fees based upon the number of End User Accounts you are using. We will provide you with the monthly rate for the Services when you order the Service, and will use this rate to calculate the Fees, for your monthly charges.</li>
                                	<li><b>Annual Plan:</b> If you select this option, you will pay for the Services on an annual basis. We will bill you: (i) Fees based upon the number of End User Accounts you are using. We will provide you with the annual rate for the Services when you order the Service, and will use this rate to calculate the Fees, for your annual charges.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Fees for Orders where you are paying with a credit card, debit card or other non-invoice form of payment are due the month prior to which you received the Services. For credit cards, or debit cards, as applicable: (i) we will charge you for all applicable Fees when due and (ii) these Fees are considered overdue after the end of the month during which you received the Services.</p>
                                <p>Where we issue an invoice for payment rather than direct debit, payment shall be due thirty (30) days after the invoice date and shall be considered overdue after such date.</p>
                                <p>We may enable other forms of payment by making them available on the Site. These other forms of payment may be subject to additional terms which you may have to accept prior using the additional forms of payment.</p>
                                <p>Overdue payments may bear interest at the rate of one-and-one-half percent per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full. You will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including legal or collection fees) incurred by us in collecting such delinquent amounts, except where such overdue amounts are due to our billing inaccuracies.</p>
                                <p>You will have thirty days to pay overdue Fees. If you do not pay overdue Fees within thirty days, we will automatically suspend you use of the Service. The duration of this suspension will be until you pay all outstanding Fees.</p>
                                <p>If you have a monthly billing plan or an annual billing plan commitment, we will continue to charge you Fees during suspension for non-payment and you must pay all outstanding Fees in order to resume use of the Services.</p>
                                <p>If you remain suspended for non-payment for more than sixty days, we may terminate this Agreement.</p>
                                <p>You are responsible for any duties, customs fees, or taxes (other than our income tax) associated with the sale of the Services, including any related penalties or interest (<b>Taxes</b>), and you will pay us for the Services without any reduction for Taxes. If we are obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to you, unless you provide us with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. If you are required by law to withhold any Taxes from payments to us, you must provide us with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such payments.</p>
                                <p>You acknowledge that the terms of agreement with your respective telecommunications network provider (<b>Network Provider</b>) will continue to apply when using the Service. As a result, you may be charged by the Network Provider for access to network connection services for the duration of the connection while accessing the Service or any such third-party charges as they may arise. You accept responsibility for any such charges that arise.</p>

                                <p>You may specify one or more administrators who will have password protected rights to access administrative account(s) for the purposes of administering the Services (<b>Admin Account(s)</b>) and to administer all End Users permitted to use the Service and who have established an End User Account.

You will obtain and maintain all required consents from End Users to allow: (i) your access, monitoring, use and disclosure of this data and Retail OEP providing you with the ability to do so and (ii) Retail OEP to provide the Services.</p>
                                <p>You are responsible for responding to a request from a third party for records relating to an End User’s use of the Services (<b>Third Party Requests</b>). Third Party Requests can be a lawful search warrant, court order, subpoena, other valid legal order, or written consent from the End User permitting the disclosure.  We will, to the extent allowed by law and by the terms of the Third Party Request: (a) promptly notify you of the receipt of a Third Party Request; (b) comply with your reasonable requests regarding its efforts to oppose a Third Party Request; and (c) provide you with the information or tools required for you to respond to the Third Party Request. You will first seek to obtain the information required to respond to the Third-Party Request on its own and will contact us only if you cannot reasonably obtain such information.</p>
